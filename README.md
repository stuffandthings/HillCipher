# Hill Cipher Decryptor 

Basic Hill Cipher decryptor I wrote for Ghost in the Shellcode 2015.

To use, hardcode in the 3x3 matrix key in the python file. When it asks for the code, give it 3 letters of the ciphertext. The loop will run forever, so just keep typing your 3 letter chunks of the ciphertext till you're done and congrats! You have successfully decrypted a hill cipher.

Look at http://crypto.interactive-maths.com/hill-cipher.html for description of how to encrypt and decrypt a hill cipher. There is a solver there, but it won't let you input a 3x3 matrix as the key.
